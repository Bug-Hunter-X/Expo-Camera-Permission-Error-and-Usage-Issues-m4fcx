This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The bug is related to camera permissions not being properly handled, leading to app crashes or blank screens. The `cameraBug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `cameraBugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation. The solution includes robust permission handling and improved usage of the Camera component's props.
