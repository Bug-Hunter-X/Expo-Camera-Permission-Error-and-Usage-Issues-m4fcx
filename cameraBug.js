This error typically arises when using Expo's `Camera` API and occurs because the camera permissions are not properly handled.  The app might request permission, but if the user denies it, the camera will not work and might throw an error that isn't explicitly handled.  Another cause is incorrect usage of the `Camera` component's props, such as referencing the camera object incorrectly or failing to specify the correct `cameraType`.
